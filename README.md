# AF Store - Frontend

For the frontend part of this fullstack project I decided to use **Remix**.

The backend is built with Strapi, a headless CMS, to help me to set up a quick REST API and manage the content.

You can find the API repository here: [Visit the AF-Store Strapi API](https://github.com/BrianC9/af-store-strapi)
